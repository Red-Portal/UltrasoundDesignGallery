\IEEEPARstart{I}{mage} processing pipelines in medical ultrasound systems are critical for the final result.

Tools for aiding visual designs have been employed in other fields such as computer graphics~\cite{10.1145/258734.258887}.

In this paper, we present the \usdg, a graphical tool for tuning medical ultrasound image pipelines only using human perception feedback.

The advantages of \usdg~are summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It uses a slider based graphical interface that enables efficient communication between the \user~and our system (\textbf{\cref{section:ui}}).
  \item It learns the \user's image quality preferences using Gaussian processes (\textbf{\cref{section:gp}}).
  \item It uses preferential Bayesian optimization for efficiently navigating high-dimensional, non-linear parameter spaces of medical ultrasound image pipelines (\textbf{\cref{section:bo}}).
  \item It enables effecient task, \user~specific tuning of medical ultrasound image processing pipelines.
\end{itemize}
