Image enhancement methods are an essential tool for improving the clinical performance of medical ultrasound imaging systems.
However, the benefits of these algorithms can only be obtained after tedious tuning of their many parameters.
Unfortunately, tuning these parameters is challenging because the clinical performance of image enhancement methods is difficult to quantify, and the parameters often form a high-dimensional space.
We present a graphical tool for tuning medical ultrasound image enhancements methods: the Ultrasound Design Gallery (USDG).
The USDG uses probabilistic machine learning to infer sonographers' subjective image quality metric and optimizes it using Bayesian optimization.
By interacting with the USDG, a sonographer can perform task-specific, personalized tuning of image enhancement algorithms without any knowledge of the algorithm.
Furthermore, we present the cascaded Laplacian pyramid diffusion (CLPD), a novel ultrasound image enhancement algorithm.
By using Laplacian pyramids in a cascaded configuration, the CLPD resolves multiple limitations of conventional Laplacian pyramid-based filters.   
Practicing sonographers were recruited for this study, who used the USDG to tune the parameters of the CLPD on liver and echocardiographic ultrasound images.
Based on our results, we suggest the use of blurriness metrics for evaluating medical ultrasound images.
