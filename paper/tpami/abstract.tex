Image enhancements methods are an important tool for improving the clinical performance of medical B-mode ultrasound imaging systems.
However, the power of these image enhancements algorithms can only be obtained after tedious tuning of their many parameters.
Unfortunately, tuning these parameters is challenging because the clinical quality of a processed image is difficult to quantify, and the parameters often form a high-dimensional space.
In this paper, an efficient graphical tool for tuning medical ultrasound image enhancements methods: the Ultrasound Design Gallery.
The Ultrasound Design Gallery uses preferential Gaussian processes for automatically analyzing the subjective image quality metric of sonographers.
Then, using Bayesian optimization, it automatically optimizes the learned quality metric.
We demonstrate the Ultrasound Design Gallery by tuning cascaded Laplacian pyramid diffusion, a novel image enhancement algorithms for medical ultrasound images
