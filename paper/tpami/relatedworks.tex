%% \subsection{Subjective Quality Assessment}
%% Subjective quality assessment of medical ultrasound images have been is important topic for accurate evaluations of ultrasound imaging techniques.
%% Hemmsen \textit{et al.} propose a software for comparing medical images using the double-stimulus continuous-quality scale~\cite{hemmsen_ultrasound_2010}.
%% Our USDG not only infers the subjective quality metric, but also attempts to optimize it.

%% An important issue is that speckle reduction filter tend to generate blurry results.

%% tend to generate blurry images regardless of the speckle reduction performance.
%% Especially, despite the superior performance of the hybrid filter~\cite{singh_hybrid_2017}.

%% \subsection{Ultrasound Image Enhancement Algorithms}
%% Applying image enhancement algorithms is an effective way to drastically improve the perceived quality of medical ultrasound images.
%% Among the vast literature of ultrasound image enhancement, our work is most related to methods based on multiscale analysis.
%% In particular, jour CLPD builds upon Laplacian pyramids~\cite{burt_laplacian_1983, zhang_nonlinear_2007}.
%% The multiscale nature of Laplacian pyramids have shown good speckle reduction capabilities~\cite{zhang_nonlinear_2007}.
%% Latter extension~\cite{zhang_multiscale_2006, kang_new_2016} have shown that they are also flexible, enabling the mixing of different image filters within the pyramid.

%% \subsection{Tuning of Medical Ultrasound Imaging Systems}
%% Various approaches for tuning medical ultrasound imaging systems have been proposed.
%% However, most of these approaches were based on optimizing objective quality metrics, which are known to deliver good results.
%% For example, specifically for image enhancement algorithms, Tay \textit{et al.} propose to maximize the \(\widehat{Q}\)-index metric~\cite{tay_ultrasound_2006}.
%% However, the \(\widehat{Q}\)-index can only be evaluated on phantoms with ground truth segmentations.
%% This significantly restricts its practicality (see~\cite{ramos-llorden_anisotropic_2015}).
